 An Architecture for Trustworthy and Transparent Digital Supply Chains
                  draft-ietf-scitt-architecture-latest

Abstract

   Traceability of physical and digital Artifacts in supply chains is a
   long-standing, but increasingly serious security concern.  The rise
   in popularity of verifiable data structures as a mechanism to
   implement accountability for tampering or equivocation has found some
   successful applications to specific use cases (such as the supply
   chain for digital certificates), but lacks a generic and scalable
   architecture that can address a wider range of use cases.

   This document defines a generic, interoperable and scalable
   architecture to enable transparency across any supply chain with
   minimum adoption barriers.  It provides flexibility, enabling
   interoperability across different implementations of Transparency
   Services with various auditing procedures and regulatory
   requirements.  Issuers can register their Signed Statements on one or
   more Transparency Services, with the guarantee that any Relying
   Parties will be able to verify them.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines an architecture, a base set of extensible
   message structures, and associated flows to make signed content
   transparent via verifiable data structures maintained by
   corresponding transparency services.  The goal of the transparency
   enabled by the Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust
   (SCITT) architecture is to enhance auditability and accountability
   for signed content (statements) that are about supply chain
   commodities (artifacts).  Registering signed statements with a
   transparency service is akin to a notarization procedure.
   Transparency services perform notary operations, confirming a policy
   is met before recording the statement on the ledger.  The SCITT
   ledger represents a linear and irrevocable history of statements
   made.  Once the signed statement is registered, the transparency
   service issues a receipt, just as a notary stamps the document being
   notarized.  Similar approaches have been implemented for specific
   classes of artifacts, such as Certificate Transparency [RFC9162].
   The SCITT approach follows a more generic paradigm than previous
   approaches.  This "content-agnostic" approach allows SCITT
   transparency services to be either integrated in existing solutions
   or to be an initial part of new emerging systems.  Extensibility is a
   vital feature of the SCITT architecture, so that requirements from
   various applications can be accommodated while always ensuring
   interoperability with respect to registration procedures and
   corresponding auditability and accountability.  For simplicity, the
   scope of this document is limited to use cases originating from the
   software supply chain domain, but the specification defined is
   applicable to any other type of supply chain statements (also
   referred to as value-add graphs), for example, statements about
   hardware supply chains.

   This document also defines message structures for signed statements
   and defines a profile for COSE receipts
   [I-D.draft-ietf-cose-merkle-tree-proofs], i.e., signed verifiable
   data structure proofs).  These message structures are based on the
   Concise Binary Object Representation Standard [STD94] and
   corresponding signing is facilitated via the CBOR Object Signing and
   Encryption Standard [STD96].  The message structures are defined
   using the Concise Data Definition Language [RFC8610].  The signed
   statements and receipts are based on the COSE_Sign1 specification in
   Section 4.2 of [STD96].  As these messages provide the foundation of
   any transparency service implementation for global and cross-domain
   application interoperability, they are based on complementary COSE
   specifications, mainly [I-D.draft-ietf-cose-merkle-tree-proofs].
   Therefore, support of COSE_Sign1 and extensibility of COSE Header
   Parameters are prerequisites for implementing the interoperable
   message layer included in this document.

   In summary, this specification supports relying parties obtaining
   proof that signed statements were recorded and checked for their
   validity at the time they were registered.  How these statements are
   managed or stored is out-of-scope of this document.

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Software Supply Chain Scope

   To illustrate the applicability of the SCITT architecture and its
   messages, this section details the exemplary context of software
   supply chain (SSC) use cases.  The building blocks provided by the
   SCITT architecture and related documents (e.g.,
   [I-D.draft-ietf-scitt-scrapi]) are not restricted to software supply
   chain use cases.  Software supply chains serve as a useful
   application guidance and first usage scenario.

2.1.  Generic SSC Problem Statement

   Supply chain security is a prerequisite to protecting consumers and
   minimizing economic, public health, and safety threats.  Supply chain
   security has historically focused on risk management practices to
   safeguard logistics, meet regulatory requirements, forecast demand,
   and optimize inventory.  While these elements are foundational to a
   healthy supply chain, an integrated cyber security-based perspective
   of the software supply chains remains broadly undefined.  Recently,
   the global community has experienced numerous supply chain attacks
   targeting weaknesses in software supply chains.  As illustrated in
   Figure 1, a software supply chain attack may leverage one or more
   life-cycle stages and directly or indirectly target the component.

                  Figure 1: Example SSC Life-Cycle Threats

   DevSecOps often depends on third-party and open-source software.
   These dependencies can be quite complex throughout the supply chain,
   so checking provenance and traceability throughout their lifecycle is
   difficult.  There is a need for manageable auditability and
   accountability of digital products.  Typically, the range of types of
   statements about digital products (and their dependencies) is vast,
   heterogeneous, and can differ between community policy requirements.
   Taking the type and structure of all statements about digital and
   products into account might not be possible.  Examples of statements
   may include commit signatures, build environment and parameters,
   software bill of materials, static and dynamic application security
   testing results, fuzz testing results, release approvals, deployment
   records, vulnerability scan results, and patch logs.  In consequence,
   instead of trying to understand and describe the detailed syntax and
   semantics of every type of statement about digital products, the
   SCITT architecture focuses on ensuring statement authenticity,
   visibility/transparency, and intends to provide scalable
   accessibility.  Threats and practical issues can also arise from
   unintended side-effects of using security techniques outside their
   proper bounds.  For instance digital signatures may fail to verify
   past their expiry date even though the signed item itself remains
   completely valid.  Or a signature may verify even though the
   information it is securing is now found unreliable but fine-grained
   revocation is too hard.

   Lastly, where data exchange underpins serious business decision-
   making, it is important to hold the producers of those data to a
   higher standard of accountability.  The SCITT architecture provides
   mechanisms and structures for ensuring that the makers of
   authoritative statements can be held accountable and not hide or
   shred the evidence when it becomes inconvenient later.

   The following use cases illustrate the scope of SCITT and elaborate
   on the generic problem statement above.

2.2.  Eclectic SSC Use Cases

   The three following use cases are a specialization derived from the
   generic problem statement above.

2.2.1.  Security Analysis of a Software Product

   A released software product is often accompanied by a set of
   complementary statements about its security properties.  This gives
   enough confidence to both producers and consumers that the released
   software meets the expected security standards and is suitable to
   use.

   Subsequently, multiple security researchers often run sophisticated
   security analysis tools on the same product.  The intention is to
   identify any security weaknesses or vulnerabilities in the package.

   Initially, a particular analysis can identify a simple weakness in a
   software component.  Over a period of time, a statement from a third-
   party illustrates that the weakness is exposed in a way that
   represents an exploitable vulnerability.  The producer of the
   software product provides a statement that confirms the linking of a
   software component vulnerability with the software product by issuing
   a product vulnerability disclosure report and also issues an advisory
   statement on how to mitigate the vulnerability.  At first, the
   producer provides an updated software product that still uses the
   vulnerable software component but shields the issue in a fashion that
   inhibits exploitation.  Later, a second update of the software
   product includes a security patch to the affected software component
   from the software producer.  Finally, a third update includes a new
   release (updated version) of the formerly insecure software
   component.  For this release, both the software product and the
   affected software component are deemed secure by the producer and
   consumers.

   A consumer of a released software wants to:

   *  know where to get these security statements from producers and
      third-parties related to the software product in a timely and
      unambiguous fashion

   *  attribute them to an authoritative issuer

   *  associate the statements in a meaningful manner via a set of well-
      known semantic relationships

   *  consistently, efficiently, and homogeneously check their
      authenticity

   SCITT provides a standardized way to:

   *  know the various sources of statements

   *  express the provenance and historicity of statements

   *  relate and link various heterogeneous statements in a simple
      fashion

   *  check that the statement comes from a source with authority to
      issue that statement

   *  confirm that sources provide a complete history of statements
      related to a given component

2.2.2.  Promotion of a Software Component by Multiple Entities

   A software component (e.g., a library or software product) released
   by a trusted producer is common practice for both open-source and
   commercial offerings.  The released software component is accompanied
   by a statement of authenticity.  Over time, due to its enhanced
   applicability to various products, there has been an increasing
   number of multiple providers of the same software component version
   on the internet.

   Some providers include this particular software component as part of
   their release product/package bundle and provide the package with
   proof of authenticity using their issuer authority.  Some packages
   include the original statement of authenticity, and some do not.
   Over time, some providers no longer offer the exact same software
   component source code but pre-compiled software component binaries.
   Some sources do not provide the exact same software component, but
   include patches and fixes produced by third-parties, as these emerge
   faster than solutions from the original producer.  Due to complex
   distribution and promotion life-cycle scenarios, the original
   software component takes myriad forms.

   A consumer of a released software wants to:

   *  understand if a particular provider is a trusted originating
      producer or an alternative party

   *  know if and how the source, or resulting binary, of a promoted
      software component differs from the original software component

   *  check the provenance and history of a software component's source
      back to its origin

   *  assess whether to trust a component or product based on a
      downloaded package location and source supplier

   SCITT provides a standardized way to:

   *  reliably discern if a provider is the original, trusted producer
      or is a trustworthy alternative provider or is an illegitimate
      provider

   *  track the provenance path from an original producer to a
      particular provider

   *  check the trustworthiness of a provider

   *  check the integrity of modifications or transformations applied by
      a provider

2.2.3.  Software Integrator Assembling a Software Product for an
        Autonomous Vehicle

   Software Integration is a complex activity.  This typically involves
   getting various software components from multiple suppliers,
   producing an integrated package deployed as part of device assembly.
   For example, car manufacturers source integrated software for their
   autonomous vehicles from third parties that integrate software
   components from various sources.  Integration complexity creates a
   higher risk of security vulnerabilities to the delivered software.

   Consumers of integrated software want:

   *  all components presents in a software product listed

   *  the ability to identify and retrieve all components from a secure
      and tamper-proof location

   *  to receive an alert when a vulnerability scan detects a known
      security issue on a running software component

   *  verifiable proofs on build process and build environment with all
      supplier tiers to ensure end to end build quality and security

   SCITT provides a standardized way to:

   *  provide a tiered and transparent framework that allows for
      verification of integrity and authenticity of the integrated
      software at both component and product level before installation

   *  notify software integrators of vulnerabilities identified during
      security scans of running software

   *  provide valid annotations on build integrity to ensure conformance

3.  Terminology

   The terms defined in this section have special meaning in the context
   of Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust, which are used
   throughout this document.  When used in text, the corresponding terms
   are capitalized.  To ensure readability, only a core set of terms is
   included in this section.

   The terms "header", "payload", and "to-be-signed bytes" are defined
   in [STD96].

   The term "claim" is defined in [RFC8392].

   Statement Sequence:  a sequence of Signed Statements captured by a
      Verifiable Data Structure. see Verifiable Data Structure

   Append-only Log:  a Statement Sequence comprising the entire
      registration history of the Transparency Service.  To make the
      Append-only property verifiable and transparent, the Transparency
      Service defines how Signed Statements are made available to
      Auditors.

   Artifact:  a physical or non-physical item that is moving along a
      supply chain.

   Auditor:  an entity that checks the correctness and consistency of
      all Transparent Statements, or the transparent Statement Sequence,
      issued by a Transparency Service.  An Auditor is an example of a
      specialized Relying Party.

   Client:  an application making protected Transparency Service
      resource requests on behalf of the resource owner and with its
      authorization.

   Envelope:  metadata, created by the Issuer to produce a Signed
      Statement.  The Envelope contains the identity of the Issuer and
      information about the Artifact, enabling Transparency Service
      Registration Policies to validate the Signed Statement.  A Signed
      Statement is a COSE Envelope wrapped around a Statement, binding
      the metadata in the Envelope to the Statement.  In COSE, an
      Envelope consists of a protected header (included in the Issuer's
      signature) and an unprotected header (not included in the Issuer's
      signature).

   Equivocation:  a state where a Transparency Service provides
      inconsistent proofs to Relying Parties, containing conflicting
      claims about the Signed Statement bound at a given position in the
      Verifiable Data Structure [EQUIVOCATION].

   Issuer:  an identifier representing an organization, device, user, or
      entity securing Statements about supply chain Artifacts.  An
      Issuer may be the owner or author of Artifacts, or an independent
      third party such as an Auditor, reviewer or an endorser.  In SCITT
      Statements and Receipts, the iss CWT Claim is a member of the COSE
      header parameter 15: CWT_Claims within the protected header of a
      COSE Envelope.

   Non-equivocation:  a state where all proofs provided by the
      Transparency Service to Relying Parties are produced from a Single
      Verifiable Data Structure describing a unique sequence of Signed
      Statements and are therefore consistent.  Over time, an Issuer may
      register new Signed Statements about an Artifact in a Transparency
      Service with new information.  However, the consistency of a
      collection of Signed Statements about the Artifact can be checked
      by all Relying Parties.

   Receipt:  a cryptographic proof that a Signed Statement is included
      in the Verifiable Data Structure.  See
      [I-D.draft-ietf-cose-merkle-tree-proofs] for implementations
      Receipts are signed proofs of verifiable data-structure
      properties.  The types of Receipts MUST support inclusion proofs
      and MAY support other proof types, such as consistency proofs.

   Registration:  the process of submitting a Signed Statement to a
      Transparency Service, applying the Transparency Service's
      Registration Policy, adding to the Verifiable Data Structure, and
      producing a Receipt.

   Registration Policy:  the pre-condition enforced by the Transparency
      Service before registering a Signed Statement, based on
      information in the non-opaque header and metadata contained in its
      COSE Envelope.

   Relying Party:  a Relying Parties consumes Transparent Statements,
      verifying their proofs and inspecting the Statement payload,
      either before using corresponding Artifacts, or later to audit an
      Artifact's provenance on the supply chain.

   Signed Statement:  an identifiable and non-repudiable Statement about
      an Artifact signed by an Issuer.  In SCITT, Signed Statements are
      encoded as COSE signed objects; the payload of the COSE structure
      contains the issued Statement.

   Statement:  any serializable information about an Artifact.  To help
      interpretation of Statements, they must be tagged with a media
      type (as specified in [RFC6838]).  A Statement may represent a
      Software Bill Of Materials (SBOM) that lists the ingredients of a
      software Artifact, an endorsement or attestation about an
      Artifact, indicate the End of Life (EOL), redirection to a newer
      version, or any content an Issuer wishes to publish about an
      Artifact.  The additional Statements about an Artifact are
      correlated by the Subject defined in the [CWT_CLAIMS] protected
      header.  The Statement is considered opaque to Transparency
      Service, and MAY be encrypted.

   Subject:  an identifier, defined by the Issuer, which represents the
      organization, device, user, entity, or Artifact about which
      Statements (and Receipts) are made and by which a logical
      collection of Statements can be grouped.  It is possible that
      there are multiple Statements about the same Artifact.  In these
      cases, distinct Issuers (iss) might agree to use the sub CWT Claim
      to create a coherent sequence of Signed Statements about the same
      Artifact and Relying Parties can leverage sub to ensure
      completeness and Non-equivocation across Statements by identifying
      all Transparent Statements associated to a specific Subject.

   Transparency Service:  an entity that maintains and extends the
      Verifiable Data Structure and endorses its state.  The identity of
      a Transparency Service is captured by a public key that must be
      known by Relying Parties in order to validate Receipts.

   Transparent Statement:  a Signed Statement that is augmented with a
      Receipt created via Registration in a Transparency Service.  The
      Receipt is stored in the unprotected header of COSE Envelope of
      the Signed Statement.  A Transparent Statement remains a valid
      Signed Statement and may be registered again in a different
      Transparency Service.

   Verifiable Data Structure:  a data structure which supports one or
      more proof types, such as "inclusion proofs" or "consistency
      proofs", for Signed Statements as they are Registered to a
      Transparency Service.  SCITT supports multiple Verifiable Data
      Structures and Receipt formats as defined in
      [I-D.draft-ietf-cose-merkle-tree-proofs], accommodating different
      Transparency Service implementations.

4.  Definition of Transparency

   In this document, the definition of transparency is intended to build
   over abstract notions of Append-only Logs and Receipts.  Existing
   transparency systems such as Certificate Transparency are instances
   of this definition.  SCITT supports multiple Verifiable Data
   Structures, as defined in [I-D.draft-ietf-cose-merkle-tree-proofs].

   A Signed Statement is an identifiable and non-repudiable Statement
   made by an Issuer.  The Issuer selects additional metadata and
   attaches a proof of endorsement (in most cases, a signature) using
   the identity key of the Issuer that binds the Statement and its
   metadata.  Signed Statements can be made transparent by attaching a
   proof of Registration by a Transparency Service, in the form of a
   Receipt.  Receipts demonstrate inclusion of Signed Statements in the
   Verifiable Data Structure of a Transparency Service.  By extension,
   the Signed Statement may say an Artifact (for example, a firmware
   binary) is transparent if it comes with one or more Transparent
   Statements from its author or owner, though the context should make
   it clear what type of Signed Statements is expected for a given
   Artifact.

   Transparency does not prevent dishonest or compromised Issuers, but
   it holds them accountable.  Any Artifact that may be verified, is
   subject to scrutiny and auditing by other parties.  The Transparency
   Service provides a history of Statements, which may be made by
   multiple Issuers, enabling Relying Parties to make informed
   decisions.

   Transparency is implemented by providing a consistent, append-only,
   cryptographically verifiable, publicly available record of entries.
   A SCITT instance is referred to as a Transparency Service.
   Implementations of Transparency Services may protect their registered
   sequence of Signed Statements and Verifiable Data Structure using a
   combination of trusted hardware, consensus protocols, and
   cryptographic evidence.  A Receipt is a signature over one or more
   Verifiable Data Structure Proofs that a Signed Statement is
   registered in the Verifiable Data Structure.  It is universally
   verifiable without online access to the TS.  Requesting a Receipt can
   result in the production of a new Receipt for the same Signed
   Statement.  A Receipt's verification key, signing algorithm, validity
   period, header parameters or other claims MAY change each time a
   Receipt is produced.

   Anyone with access to the Transparency Service can independently
   verify its consistency and review the complete list of Transparent
   Statements registered by each Issuer.

   Reputable Issuers are thus incentivized to carefully review their
   Statements before signing them to produce Signed Statements.
   Similarly, reputable Transparency Services are incentivized to secure
   their Verifiable Data Structure, as any inconsistency can easily be
   pinpointed by any Auditor with read access to the Transparency
   Service.

   The building blocks defined in SCITT are intended to support
   applications in any supply chain that produces or relies upon digital
   Artifacts, from the build and supply of software and IoT devices to
   advanced manufacturing and food supply.

   SCITT is a generalization of Certificate Transparency (CT) [RFC9162],
   which can be interpreted as a transparency architecture for the
   supply chain of X.509 certificates.  Considering CT in terms of
   SCITT:

   *  CAs (Issuers) sign the ASN.1 DER encoded tbsCertificate structure
      to produce an X.509 certificate (Signed Statements)

   *  CAs submit the certificates to one or more CT logs (Transparency
      Services)

   *  CT logs produce Signed Certificate Timestamps (Transparent
      Statements)

   *  Signed Certificate Timestamps, Signed Tree Heads, and their
      respective consistency proofs are checked by Relying Parties

   *  The Verifiable Data Structure can be checked by Auditors

5.  Architecture Overview

   The SCITT architecture enables a loose federation of Transparency
   Services, by providing a set of common formats and protocols for
   issuing and registering Signed Statements and auditing Transparent
   Statements.

   In order to accommodate as many Transparency Service implementations
   as possible, this document only specifies the format of Signed
   Statements (which must be used by all Issuers) and a very thin
   wrapper format for Receipts, which specifies the Transparency Service
   identity and the agility parameters for the Signed Inclusion Proofs.
   The remaining details of the Receipt's contents are specified in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-cose-merkle-tree-proofs].

   Figure 2 illustrates the roles and processes that comprise a
   Transparency Service independent of any one use case:

   *  Issuers that use their credentials to create Signed Statements
      about Artifacts

   *  Transparency Services that evaluate Signed Statements against
      Registration Policies, producing Receipts upon successful
      Registration.  The returned Receipt may be combined with the
      Signed Statement to create a Transparent Statement.

   *  Relying Parties that:

      -  collect Receipts of Signed Statements for subsequent
         registration of Transparent Statements;

      -  retrieve Transparent Statements for analysis of Statements
         about Artifacts themselves (e.g. verification);

      -  or replay all the Transparent Statements to check for the
         consistency and correctness of the Transparency Service's
         Verifiable Data Structure (e.g. auditing)

   In addition, Figure 2 illustrates multiple Transparency Services and
   multiple Receipts as a single Signed Statement MAY be registered with
   one or more Transparency Service.  Each Transparency Service produces
   a Receipt, which may be aggregated in a single Transparent Statement,
   demonstrating the Signed Statement was registered by multiple
   Transparency Services.

   The arrows indicate the flow of information.

                Figure 2: Relationship of Concepts in SCITT

   The subsequent sections describe the main concepts, namely
   Transparency Service, Signed Statements, Registration, and
   Transparent Statements in more detail.

5.1.  Transparency Service

   Transparency Services MUST feature a Verifiable Data Structure.  The
   Verifiable Data Structure records registered Signed Statements and
   supports the production of Receipts.

   All Transparency Services MUST expose the minimally conformant APIs,
   defined in ([I-D.draft-ietf-scitt-scrapi] for the Registration of
   Signed Statements and issuance of Receipts.

   Transparency Services MAY support additional APIs for auditing, for
   instance querying the history of Signed Statements.

   Typically a Transparency Service has a single Issuer identity which
   is present in the iss Claim of Receipts for that service.

   Multi-tenant support can be enabled through the use of identifiers in
   the iss Claim, for example, ts.example may have a distinct Issuer
   identity for each sub domain, such as customer1.ts.example and
   customer2.ts.example.

5.1.1.  Registration Policies

   Registration Policies refer to additional checks over and above the
   Mandatory Registration Checks that are performed before a Signed
   Statement is registered to the Verifiable Data Structure.  To enable
   audit-ability, Transparency Services MUST maintain Registration
   Policies.

   Beyond the mandatory Registration checks, the scope of additional
   checks, including no additional checks, is up to the implementation.

   This specification leaves implementation, encoding and documentation
   of Registration Policies and trust anchors to the operator of the
   Transparency Service.

5.1.1.1.  Mandatory Registration Checks

   During Registration, a Transparency Service MUST, at a minimum,
   syntactically check the Issuer of the Signed Statement by
   cryptographically verifying the COSE signature according to [STD96].
   The Issuer identity MUST be bound to the Signed Statement by
   including an identifier in the protected header.  If the protected
   header includes multiple identifiers, all those that are registered
   by the Transparency Service MUST be checked.

   Transparency Services MUST maintain a list of trust anchors (see
   definition of trust anchor in [RFC4949]) in order to check the
   signatures of Signed Statements, either separately, or inside
   Registration Policies.  Transparency Services MUST authenticate
   Signed Statements as part of a Registration Policy.  For instance, a
   trust anchor could be an X.509 root certificate (directly or its
   thumbprint), a pointer to an OpenID Connect identity provider, or any
   other COSE-compatible trust anchor.

   When using X.509 Signed Statements, the Transparency Service MUST
   build and validate a complete certification path from an Issuer's
   certificate to one of the root certificates currently registered as a
   trust anchor by the Transparency Service.  The protected header of
   the COSE_Sign1 Envelope MUST include either the Issuer's certificate
   as x5t or the chain including the Issuer's certificate as x5chain.
   If x5t is included in the protected header, an x5chain with a leaf
   certificate corresponding to the x5t value MAY be included in the
   unprotected header.

   Registration Policies and trust anchors MUST be made Transparent and
   available to all Relying Parties of the Transparency Service by
   Registering them as Signed Statements on the Verifiable Data
   Structure.

   The Transparency Service MUST apply the Registration Policy that was
   most recently committed to the Verifiable Data Structure at the time
   of Registration.

5.1.1.2.  Auditability of Registration

   The operator of a Transparency Service MAY update the Registration
   Policy or the trust anchors of a Transparency Service at any time.

   Transparency Services MUST ensure that for any Signed Statement they
   register, enough information is made available to Auditors to
   reproduce the Registration checks that were defined by the
   Registration Policies at the time of Registration.

5.1.2.  Initialization and Bootstrapping

   Since the mandatory Registration checks rely on having registered
   Signed Statements for the Registration Policy and trust anchors,
   Transparency Services MUST support at least one of the three
   following bootstrapping mechanisms:

   *  Pre-configured Registration Policy and trust anchors;

   *  Acceptance of a first Signed Statement whose payload is a valid
      Registration Policy, without performing Registration checks

   *  An out-of-band authenticated management interface

5.1.3.  Verifiable Data Structure

   The security properties are determined by the choice of the
   Verifiable Data Structure ([I-D.draft-ietf-cose-merkle-tree-proofs])
   used by the Transparency Service implementation.  This verifiable
   data structure MUST support the following security requirements:

   Append-Only:  a property required for a verifiable data structure to
      be applicable to SCITT, ensuring that the Statement Sequence
      cannot be modified, deleted, or reordered.

   Non-equivocation:  there is no fork in the registered sequence of
      Signed Statements accepted by the Transparency Service and
      committed to the Verifiable Data Structure.  Everyone with access
      to its content sees the same ordered collection of Signed
      Statements and can check that it is consistent with any Receipts
      they have verified.

   Replayability:  the Verifiable Data Structure includes sufficient
      information to enable authorized actors with access to its content
      to check that each data structure representing each Signed
      Statement has been correctly registered.

   In addition to Receipts, some verifiable data structures might
   support additional proof types, such as proofs of consistency, or
   proofs of non-inclusion.

   Specific verifiable data structures, such those describes in
   [RFC9162] and [I-D.draft-ietf-cose-merkle-tree-proofs], and the
   review of their security requirements for SCITT are out of scope for
   this document.

5.1.4.  Adjacent Services

   Transparency Services can be deployed along side other database or
   object storage technologies.  For example, a Transparency Service
   that supports a software package management system, might be
   referenced from the APIs exposed for package management.  Providing
   an ability to request a fresh Receipt for a given software package,
   or to request a list of Signed Statements associated with the
   software package.

6.  Signed Statements

   This specification prioritizes conformance to [STD96] and its
   required and optional properties.  Profiles and implementation
   specific choices should be used to determine admissibility of
   conforming messages.  This specification is left intentionally open
   to allow implementations to make Registration restrictions that make
   the most sense for their operational use cases.

   There are many types of Statements (such as SBOMs, malware scans,
   audit reports, policy definitions) that Issuers may want to turn into
   Signed Statements.  An Issuer must first decide on a suitable format
   (3: payload type) to serialize the Statement payload.  For a software
   supply chain, payloads describing the software Artifacts may include:

   *  [COSWID]

   *  [CycloneDX]

   *  [in-toto]

   *  [SPDX-CBOR]

   *  [SPDX-JSON]

   *  [SLSA]

   *  [SWID]

   Once all the Envelope headers are set, an Issuer MUST use a standard
   COSE implementation to produce an appropriately serialized Signed
   Statement.

   Issuers can produce Signed Statements about different Artifacts under
   the same Identity.  Issuers and Relying Parties must be able to
   recognize the Artifact to which the Statements pertain by looking at
   the Signed Statement.  The iss and sub Claims, within the CWT_Claims
   protected header, are used to identify the Artifact the Statement
   pertains to.  (See Subject under Section 3 Terminology.)

   Issuers MAY use different signing keys (identified by kid in the
   protected header) for different Artifacts or sign all Signed
   Statements under the same key.

   An Issuer can make multiple Statements about the same Artifact.  For
   example, an Issuer can make amended Statements about the same
   Artifact as their view changes over time.

   Multiple Issuers can make different, even conflicting Statements,
   about the same Artifact.  Relying Parties can choose which Issuers
   they trust.

   Multiple Issuers can make the same Statement about a single Artifact,
   affirming multiple Issuers agree.

   Additionally, x5chain that corresponds to either x5t or kid
   identifying the leaf certificate in the included certification path
   MAY be included in the unprotected header of the COSE Envelope.

   *  When using x.509 certificates, support for either x5t or x5chain
      in the protected header is REQUIRED to implement.

   *  Support for kid in the protected header and x5chain in the
      unprotected header is OPTIONAL to implement.

   When x5t or x5chain is present in the protected header, iss MUST be a
   string that meets URI requirements defined in [RFC8392].  The iss
   value's length MUST be between 1 and 8192 characters in length.

   The kid header parameter MUST be present when neither x5t nor x5chain
   is present in the protected header.  Key discovery protocols are out-
   of-scope of this document.

   The protected header of a Signed Statement and a Receipt MUST include
   the CWT Claims header parameter as specified in Section 2 of
   [CWT_CLAIMS_COSE].  The CWT Claims value MUST include the Issuer
   Claim (Claim label 1) and the Subject Claim (Claim label 2)
   [IANA.cwt].

   A Receipt is a Signed Statement, (COSE_Sign1), with additional Claims
   in its protected header related to verifying the inclusion proof in
   its unprotected header.  See
   [I-D.draft-ietf-cose-merkle-tree-proofs].

6.1.  Signed Statement Examples

   Figure 3 illustrates a normative CDDL definition [RFC8610] for the
   protected header and unprotected header of Signed Statements and
   Receipts.

   The SCITT architecture specifies the minimal mandatory labels.
   Implementation-specific Registration Policies may define additional
   mandatory labels.

   Signed_Statement = #6.18(COSE_Sign1)
   Receipt = #6.18(COSE_Sign1)

   COSE_Sign1 = [
     protected   : bstr .cbor Protected_Header,
     unprotected : Unprotected_Header,
     payload     : bstr / nil,
     signature   : bstr
   ]

   Protected_Header = {
     &(CWT_Claims: 15) => CWT_Claims
     ? &(alg: 1) => int
     ? &(content_type: 3) => tstr / uint
     ? &(kid: 4) => bstr
     ? &(x5t: 34) => COSE_CertHash
     * int => any
   }

   CWT_Claims = {
     &(iss: 1) => tstr
     &(sub: 2) => tstr
     * int => any
   }

   Unprotected_Header = {
     ? &(x5chain: 33) => COSE_X509
     ? &(receipts: TBD_0)  => [+ Receipt]
     * int => any
   }

        Figure 3: CDDL definition for Signed Statements and Receipts

   Figure 4 illustrates an instance of a Signed Statement in Extended
   Diagnostic Notation (EDN), with a payload that is detached.  Detached
   payloads support large Statements, and ensure Signed Statements can
   integrate with existing storage systems.

         {},                           / Unprotected      /
         nil,                          / Detached payload /
         h'79ada558...3a28bae4'        / Signature        /
       ]
   )

   Statement in Figure 4.  It indicates the Signed Statement is securing
   a JSON content type, and identifying the content with the sub Claim
   "vendor.product.example".

       2: vendor.product.example,      / Subject          /
     }
   }

6.2.  Registration of Signed Statements

   To register a Signed Statement, the Transparency Service performs the
   following steps:

   1.  *Client authentication:* A Client authenticates with the
       Transparency Service before registering Signed Statements on
       behalf of one or more Issuers.  Authentication and authorization
       are implementation-specific and out of scope of the SCITT
       architecture.

   2.  *TS Signed Statement Verification and Validation:* The
       Transparency Service MUST perform signature verification per
       Section 4.4 of [STD96] and MUST verify the signature of the
       Signed Statement with the signature algorithm and verification
       key of the Issuer per [RFC9360].  The Transparency Service MUST
       also check the Signed Statement includes the required protected
       headers.  The Transparency Service MAY validate the Signed
       Statement payload in order to enforce domain specific
       registration policies that apply to specific content types.

   3.  *Apply Registration Policy:* The Transparency Service MUST check
       the attributes required by a Registration Policy are present in
       the protected headers.  Custom Signed Statements are evaluated
       given the current Transparency Service state and the entire
       Envelope and may use information contained in the attributes of
       named policies.

   4.  *Register the Signed Statement*

   5.  *Return the Receipt*, which MAY be asynchronous from
       Registration.  The Transparency Service MUST be able to provide a
       Receipt for all registered Signed Statements.  Details about
       generating Receipts are described in Section 7.

   The last two steps may be shared between a batch of Signed Statements
   registered in the Verifiable Data Structure.

   A Transparency Service MUST ensure that a Signed Statement is
   registered before releasing its Receipt.

   A Transparency Service MAY accept a Signed Statement with content in
   its unprotected header, and MAY use values from that unprotected
   header during verification and registration policy evaluation.

   However, the unprotected header of a Signed Statement MUST be set to
   an empty map before the Signed Statement can be included in a
   Statement Sequence.

   The same Signed Statement may be independently registered in multiple
   Transparency Services, producing multiple, independent Receipts.  The
   multiple Receipts may be attached to the unprotected header of the
   Signed Statement, creating a Transparent Statement.

7.  Transparent Statements

   The Client (which is not necessarily the Issuer) that registers a
   Signed Statement and receives a Receipt can produce a Transparent
   Statement by adding the Receipt to the unprotected header of the
   Signed Statement.  Client applications MAY register Signed Statements
   on behalf of one or more Issuers.  Client applications MAY request
   Receipts regardless of the identity of the Issuer of the associated
   Signed Statement.

   When a Signed Statement is registered by a Transparency Service a
   Receipt becomes available.  When a Receipt is included in a Signed
   Statement a Transparent Statement is produced.

   Receipts are based on Signed Inclusion Proofs as described in COSE
   Receipts [I-D.draft-ietf-cose-merkle-tree-proofs] that also provides
   the COSE header parameter semantics for label TBD_0.

   The Registration time is recorded as the timestamp when the
   Transparency Service added the Signed Statement to its Verifiable
   Data Structure.

   Figure 6 illustrates a normative CDDL definition of Transparent
   Statements.  See Figure 3 for the CDDL rule that defines 'COSE_Sign1'
   as specified in Section 4.2 of [STD96]

   Transparent_Statement = #6.18(COSE_Sign1)

   Unprotected_Header = {
     &(receipts: TBD_0)  => [+ Receipt]
   }

           Figure 6: CDDL definition for a Transparent Statement

   Figure 7 illustrates a Transparent Statement with a detached payload,
   and two Receipts in its unprotected header.  The type of label TBD_0
   receipts in the unprotected header is a CBOR array that can contain
   one or more Receipts (each entry encoded as a .cbor encoded
   Receipts).

   18(                                 / COSE Sign 1               /
       [
         h'a4012603...6d706c65',       / Protected                 /
         {                             / Unprotected               /
           TBD_0: [                    / Receipts (2)              /
             h'd284586c...4191f9d2'    / Receipt 1                 /
             h'c624586c...8f4af97e'    / Receipt 2                 /
           ]
         },
         nil,                          / Detached payload          /
         h'79ada558...3a28bae4'        / Signature                 /
       ]

7.1.  Validation

   Relying Parties MUST apply the verification process as described in
   Section 4.4 of [STD96], when checking the signature of Signed
   Statements and Receipts.

   A Relying Party MUST trust the verification key or certificate and
   the associated identity of at least one Issuer of a Receipt.

   A Relying Party MAY decide to verify only a single Receipt that is
   acceptable to them and not check the signature on the Signed
   Statement or Receipts which rely on verifiable data structures which
   they do not understand.

   APIs exposing verification logic for Transparent Statements may
   provide more details than a single boolean result.  For example, an
   API may indicate if the signature on the Receipt or Signed Statement
   is valid, if Claims related to the validity period are valid, or if
   the inclusion proof in the Receipt is valid.

   Relying Parties MAY be configured to re-verify the Issuer's Signed
   Statement locally.

   In addition, Relying Parties MAY apply arbitrary validation policies
   after the Transparent Statement has been verified and validated.
   Such policies may use as input all information in the Envelope, the
   Receipt, and the Statement payload, as well as any local state.

8.  Privacy Considerations

   Interactions with Transparency Services are expected to use
   appropriately strong encryption and authorization technologies.

   The Transparency Service is trusted with the confidentiality of the
   Signed Statements presented for Registration.  Issuers and Clients
   are responsible for verifying that the Transparency Service's privacy
   and security posture is suitable for the contents of the Signed
   Statements they submit prior to Registration.  Issuers must carefully
   review the inclusion of private, confidential, or personally
   identifiable information (PII) in their Statements against the
   Transparency Service's privacy posture.

   In some deployments a special role such as an Auditor might require
   and be given access to both the Transparency Service and related
   Adjacent Services.

   Transparency Services can leverage Verifiable Data Structures which
   only retain cryptographic metadata (e.g. a hash), rather than the
   complete Signed Statement, as part of a defense in depth approach to
   maintaining confidentiality.  By analyzing the relationship between
   data stored in the Transparency Service and data stored in Adjacent
   Services, it is possible to perform metadata analysis, which could
   reveal the order in which artifacts were built, signed, and uploaded.

9.  Security Considerations

   On its own, verifying a Transparent Statement does not guarantee that
   its Envelope or contents are trustworthy.  Just that they have been
   signed by the apparent Issuer and counter-signed by the Transparency
   Service.  If the Relying Party trusts the Issuer, after validation of
   the Issuer identity, it can infer that an Issuer's Signed Statement
   was issued with this Envelope and contents, which may be interpreted
   as the Issuer saying the Artifact is fit for its intended purpose.
   If the Relying Party trusts the Transparency Service, it can
   independently infer that the Signed Statement passed the Transparency
   Service Registration Policy and that has been persisted in the
   Verifiable Data Structure.  Unless advertised in the Transparency
   Service Registration Policy, the Relying Party cannot assume that the
   ordering of Signed Statements in the Verifiable Data Structure
   matches the ordering of their issuance.

   Similarly, the fact that an Issuer can be held accountable for its
   Transparent Statements does not on its own provide any mitigation or
   remediation mechanism in case one of these Transparent Statements
   turned out to be misleading or malicious.  Just that signed evidence
   will be available to support them.

   An Issuer that knows of a changed state of quality for an Artifact,
   SHOULD Register a new Signed Statement, using the same 15 CWT iss and
   sub Claims.

   Issuers MUST ensure that the Statement payloads in their Signed
   Statements are correct and unambiguous, for example by avoiding ill-
   defined or ambiguous formats that may cause Relying Parties to
   interpret the Signed Statement as valid for some other purpose.

   Issuers and Transparency Services MUST carefully protect their
   private signing keys and avoid these keys being used for any purpose
   not described in this architecture document.  In cases where key re-
   use is unavoidable, keys MUST NOT sign any other message that may be
   verified as an Envelope as part of a Signed Statement.

   For instance, the code for the Registration Policy evaluation and
   endorsement may be protected by running in a Trusted Execution
   Environment (TEE).

   The Transparency Service may be replicated with a consensus
   algorithm, such as Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance [PBFT] and may
   be used to protect against malicious or vulnerable replicas.
   Threshold signatures may be use to protect the service key, etc.

   Issuers and Transparency Services MUST rotate their keys in well-
   defined cryptoperiods, see [KEY-MANAGEMENT].

   A Transparency Service MAY provide additional authenticity assurances
   about its secure implementation and operation, enabling remote
   attestation of the hardware platforms and/or software Trusted
   Computing Bases (TCB) that run the Transparency Service.  If present,
   these additional authenticity assurances MUST be registered in the
   Verifiable Data Structure and MUST always be exposed by the
   Transparency Services' APIs.  An example of Signed Statement's
   payloads that can improve authenticity assurances are trustworthiness
   assessments that are RATS Conceptual Messages, such as Evidence,
   Endorsements, or corresponding Attestation Results (see [RFC9334]).

   For example, if a Transparency Service is implemented using a set of
   redundant replicas, each running within its own hardware-protected
   trusted execution environments (TEEs), then each replica can provide
   fresh Evidence or fresh Attestation Results about its TEEs.  The
   respective Evidence can show, for example, the binding of the
   hardware platform to the software that runs the Transparency Service,
   the long-term public key of the service, or the key used by the
   replica for signing Receipts.  The respective Attestation Result, for
   example, can show that the remote attestation Evidence was appraised
   by a Relying Party and complies with well-known Reference Values and
   Endorsements.

   Auditors should be aware that the certification path information
   included in an unprotected x5chain header of a to-be-registered
   Signed Statement can be tampered with by a malicious Transparency
   Service (e.g., one that does not incorporate remote attestation),
   which may replace the intermediate certificates and ultimately
   connect to an unexpected root.  This modification helps protect
   against person-in-the-middle attacks, but not denial-of-service.
   Auditors MUST perform certification path validation in accordance
   with PKIX rules specified in [RFC5280].  Auditors MUST verify that
   certification paths chain to one or more trust anchors (often
   represented as root certificates).

9.1.  Security Guarantees

   SCITT provides the following security guarantees:

   1.  Statements made by Issuers about supply chain Artifacts are
       identifiable, can be authenticated, and once authenticated, are
       non-repudiable

   2.  Statement provenance and history can be independently and
       consistently audited

   3.  Issuers can efficiently prove that their Statement is logged by a
       Transparency Service

   The first guarantee is achieved by requiring Issuers to sign their
   Statements and associated metadata using a distributed public key
   infrastructure.  The second guarantee is achieved by committing the
   Signed Statement to a Verifiable Data Structure.  The third guarantee
   is achieved by the combination of both of these acts.

9.2.  Threat Model

   This section provides a generic threat model for SCITT, describing
   its residual security properties when some of its actors (Issuers,
   Transparency Services, and Auditors) are corrupt or compromised.

   This threat model may need to be refined to account for specific
   supply chain use cases.

   SCITT primarily supports checking of Signed Statement authenticity,
   both from the Issuer (authentication) and from the Transparency
   Service (transparency).  These guarantees are meant to hold for
   extensive periods of time, possibly decades.

   It can never be assumed that some Issuers and some Transparency
   Services will not be corrupt.

   SCITT entities explicitly trust one another on the basis of their
   long-term identity, which maps to shorter-lived cryptographic
   credentials.  A Relying Party SHOULD validate a Transparent Statement
   originating from a given Issuer, registered at a given Transparency
   Service (both identified in the Relying Party's local authorization
   policy) and would not depend on any other Issuer or Transparency
   Services.

   Issuers cannot be stopped from producing Signed Statements including
   false assertions in their Statement payload (either by mistake or by
   corruption), but these Issuers can made accountable by ensuring their
   Signed Statements are systematically registered at a Transparency
   Service.

   Similarly, providing strong residual guarantees against faulty/
   corrupt Transparency Services is a SCITT design goal.  Preventing a
   Transparency Service from registering Signed Statements that do not
   meet its stated Registration Policy, or to issue Receipts that are
   not consistent with their Verifiable Data Structure is not possible.
   In contrast, Transparency Services can be held accountable and blamed
   by an Auditor that replays the Sequence of Signed Statements captured
   in their Verifiable Data Structure to confirm that a contested
   Receipt is valid and was correctly registered.

   Transparency Services can provide consistency proofs allowing
   Auditors to check if a set of Receipts were issued from a single
   Verifiable Data Structure, without replaying individual Signed
   Statements.

   Certain Verifiable Data Structures enable a Transparency Service to
   prove the properties of its Statement Sequence.  For example, proving
   a specific Signed Statement is included in the sequence, or that the
   sequence has only been extended (Append-only property) since the last
   time such a proof was created.

   Note that the SCITT Architecture does not require trust in a single
   centralized Transparency Service.  Different actors may rely on
   different Transparency Services, each registering a subset of Signed
   Statements subject to their own policy.

   In both cases, the SCITT architecture provides generic, universally-
   verifiable cryptographic proofs to individually blame Issuers or the
   Transparency Service.  On one hand, this enables valid actors to
   detect and disambiguate malicious actors who employ Equivocation with
   Signed Statements to different entities.  On the other hand, their
   liability and the resulting damage to their reputation are
   application specific, and out of scope of the SCITT architecture.

   Relying Parties and Auditors need not be trusted by other actors.  So
   long as actors maintain proper control of their signing keys and
   identity infrastructure they cannot "frame" an Issuer or a
   Transparency Service for Signed Statements they did not issue or
   register.

9.2.1.  Verifiable Data Structure

   If a Transparency Service is honest, then a Transparent Statement
   including a correct Receipt ensures that the associated Signed
   Statement passed its Registration Policy and was registered
   appropriately.

   Conversely, a corrupt Transparency Service may:

   1.  refuse or delay the Registration of Signed Statements

   2.  register Signed Statements that do not pass its Registration
       Policy (e.g., Signed Statement with Issuer identities and
       signatures that do not verify)

   3.  issue verifiable Receipts for Signed Statements that do not match
       its Verifiable Data Structure

   4.  refuse access to its Transparency Service (e.g., to Auditors,
       possibly after storage loss)

   An Auditor granted (partial) access to a Transparency Service and to
   a collection of disputed Receipts will be able to replay it, detect
   any invalid Registration (2) or incorrect Receipt in this collection
   (3), and blame the Transparency Service for them.  This ensures any
   Relying Party that trusts at least one such Auditor that (2, 3) will
   be blamed to the Transparency Service.

   Due to the operational challenge of maintaining a globally consistent
   Verifiable Data Structure, some Transparency Services may provide
   limited support for historical queries on the Signed Statements they
   have registered and accept the risk of being blamed for inconsistent
   Registration or Issuer Equivocation.

   Relying Parties and Auditors may also witness (1, 4) but may not be
   able to collect verifiable evidence for it.

9.2.2.  Availability of Receipts

   Networking and Storage are trusted only for availability.

   Auditing may involve access to data beyond what is persisted in the
   Transparency Services.  For example, the registered Transparency
   Service may include only the hash of a detailed SBOM, which may limit
   the scope of auditing.

   Resistance to denial-of-service is implementation specific.

   Actors may want to independently keep their own record of the Signed
   Statements they issue, endorse, verify, or audit.

9.2.3.  Cryptographic Agility

   The SCITT Architecture supports cryptographic agility.  The actors
   depend only on the subset of signing and Receipt schemes they trust.
   This enables the gradual transition to stronger algorithms, including
   e.g. post-quantum signature algorithms.

9.2.4.  Transparency Service Client Applications

   Authentication of Client applications is out of scope for this
   document.  Transparency Services MAY authenticate Client
   applications.  The specification of authentication and authorization
   policies is out of scope for this document.

9.2.5.  Impersonation

   The identity resolution mechanism is trusted to associate long-term
   identifiers with their public signature-verification keys.
   Transparency Services and other parties may record identity-
   resolution evidence to facilitate its auditing.

   If one of the credentials of an Issuer gets compromised, the SCITT
   Architecture still guarantees the authenticity of all Signed
   Statements signed with this credential that have been registered on a
   Transparency Service before the compromise.  It is up to the Issuer
   to notify Transparency Services of credential revocation to stop
   Relying Parties from accepting Signed Statements signed with
   compromised credentials.

Appendix A.  Common Terminology Disambiguation

   This document has been developed in coordination with the COSE, OAUTH
   and RATS WG and uses terminology common to these working groups.

   This document uses the terms "Issuer", and "Subject" as described in
   [RFC8392], however the usage is consistent with the broader
   interpretation of these terms in both JOSE and COSE, and the guidance
   in [RFC8725] generally applies the COSE equivalent terms with
   consistent semantics.

   The terms "verifier" and "Relying Party" are used interchangeably
   through the document.  While these terms are related to "Verifier"
   and "Relying Party" as used in [RFC9334], they do not imply the
   processing of RATS conceptual messages, such as Evidence or
   Attestation Results that are specific to remote attestation.  A SCITT
   "verifier" and "Relying Party" and "Issuer" of Receipts or Statements
   might take on the role of a RATS "Attester".  Correspondingly, all
   RATS conceptual messages, such as Evidence and Attestation Results,
   can be the content of SCITT Statements and a SCITT "verifier" can
   also take on the role of a RATS "Verifier" to, for example, conduct
   the procedure of Appraisal of Evidence as a part of a SCITT
   "verifier"'s verification capabilities.

   The terms "Claim" and "Statement" are used throughout this document,
   where Claim is consistent with the usage in [I-D.draft-ietf-rats-eat]
   and [RFC7523], and Statement is reserved for any arbitrary bytes,
   possibly identified with a media type, about which the Claims are
   made.

   The term "Subject" provides an identifier of the Issuer's choosing to
   refer to a given Artifact and ensures that all associated Statements
   can be attributed to the identifier chosen by the Issuer.

   In simpler language, a SCITT Statement could be some vendor-specific
   software bill of materials (SBOM), results from a model checker,
   static analyzer, or RATS Evidence about the authenticity of an SBOM
   creation process, where the Issuer identifies themselves using the
   iss Claim, and the specific software that was analyzed as the Subject
   using the sub Claim.

   In [RFC7523], the Authorization Server (AS) verifies Private Key JWT
   client authentication requests, and issues access tokens to clients
   configured to use "urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-
   bearer".  This means the AS initially acts as a "verifier" of the
   authentication credentials in form of a JWT, and then later as an
   "Issuer" of access and refresh tokens.  This mirrors how Signed
   Statements are verified before Receipts are issued by a Transparency
   Service.  Note that the use of [RFC7523] is only one possible
   approach for client authentication in OAuth.

   [FIPS.201] defines "assertion" as "A verifiable statement from an IdP
   to an RP that contains information about an end user".

   [NIST.SP.800-63-3] defines "assertion" as "A statement from a
   verifier to an RP that contains information about a subscriber.
   Assertions may also contain verified attributes."

   This document uses the term Statement to refer to potentially
   unsecured data and associated Claims, and Signed Statement and
   Receipt to refer to assertions from an Issuer, or the Transparency
   Service.

   [NIST.SP.1800-19] defines "attestation" as "The process of providing
   a digital signature for a set of measurements securely stored in
   hardware, and then having the requester validate the signature and
   the set of measurements."

   NIST guidance "Software Supply Chain Security Guidance EO 14028" uses
   the definition from [NIST_EO14028], which states that an
   "attestation" is "The issue of a statement, based on a decision, that
   fulfillment of specified requirements has been demonstrated.".  In
   the RATS context, a "NIST attestation" is similar to a RATS
   "Endorsement".  Occasionally, RATS Evidence and RATS Attestation
   Results or the procedures of creating these conceptual messages are
   referred to as "attestation" or (in cases of the use as a verb) "to
   attest".  The stand-alone use of "attestation" and "to attest" is
   discouraged outside a well-defined context, such as specification
   text that highlights the application of terminology, explicitly.
   Correspondingly, it is often useful for the intended audience to
   qualify the term "attestation" to avoid confusion and ambiguity.

Appendix B.  Signing Statements Remotely

   Statements about digital Artifacts, containing digital Artifacts, or
   structured data regarding any type of Artifacts, can be too large or
   too sensitive to be send to a remote Transparency Services over the
   Internet.  In these cases a Statement can also be hash, which becomes
   the payload included in COSE to-be-signed bytes.  A Signed Statement
   (COSE_Sign1) MUST be produced from the to-be-signed bytes according
   to Section 4.4 of [STD96].
