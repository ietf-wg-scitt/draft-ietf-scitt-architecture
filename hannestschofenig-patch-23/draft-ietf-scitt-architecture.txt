 An Architecture for Trustworthy and Transparent Digital Supply Chains
                  draft-ietf-scitt-architecture-latest

Abstract

   Traceability of physical and digital Artifacts in supply chains is a
   long-standing, but increasingly serious security concern.  The rise
   in popularity of verifiable data structures as a mechanism to make
   actors more accountable for breaching their compliance promises has
   found some successful applications to specific use cases (such as the
   supply chain for digital certificates), but lacks a generic and
   scalable architecture that can address a wider range of use cases.

   This document defines a generic, interoperable and scalable
   architecture to enable transparency across any supply chain with
   minimum adoption barriers.  It provides flexibility, enabling
   interoperability across different implementations of Transparency
   Services with various auditing and compliance requirements.  Issuers
   can register their Signed Statements on any Transparency Service,
   with the guarantee that any Relying Parties will be able to verify
   them.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes the generic, interoperable, and scalable
   SCITT architecture.  Its goal is to enhance auditability and
   accountability across supply chains.

   In supply chains, downstream Artifacts are built upon upstream
   Artifacts.  The complexity of traceability and quality control for
   these supply chains increases with the number of Artifacts and
   parties contributing to them.  There are many parties who publish
   information about Artifacts: For example, the original manufacturer
   may provide information about the state of the Artifact when it left
   the factory.  The shipping company may add information about the
   transport environment of the Artifact.  Compliance Auditors may
   provide information about their compliance assessment of the
   Artifact.  Security companies may publish vulnerability information
   about an Artifact.  Some of these parties may publish information
   about their analysis or use of an Artifact.

   SCITT provides a way for Relying Parties to obtain this information
   in a way that is "transparent", that is, parties cannot lie about the
   information that they publish without it being detected.  SCITT
   achieves this by having producers publish information in a
   Transparency Service, where Relying Parties can check the
   information.

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Terminology

   The terms defined in this section have special meaning in the context
   of Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust, which are used
   throughout this document.  When used in text, the corresponding terms
   are capitalized.  To ensure readability, only a core set of terms is
   included in this section.

   The terms "header", "payload", and "to-be-signed bytes" are defined
   in [RFC9052].

   The term "claim" is defined in [RFC8392].

   Append-only Log (Ledger):  the verifiable append-only data structure
      that stores Signed Statements in a Transparency Service, often
      referred to by the synonym Ledger.  SCITT supports multiple Ledger
      and Receipt formats to accommodate different Transparency Service
      implementations, and the proof types associated with different
      types of Append-only Logs.

   Artifact:  a physical or non-physical item that is moving along a
      supply chain.

   Auditor:  an entity that checks the correctness and consistency of
      all Transparent Statements issued by a Transparency Service.  An
      Auditor is an example of a specialized Relying Party.

   Client:  an application making protected Transparency Service
      resource requests on behalf of the resource owner and with its
      authorization.

   Envelope:  metadata, created by the Issuer to produce a Signed
      Statement.  The Envelope contains the identity of the Issuer and
      information about the Artifact, enabling Transparency Service
      Registration Policies to validate the Signed Statement.  A Signed
      Statement is a COSE Envelope wrapped around a Statement, binding
      the metadata in the Envelope to the Statement.  In COSE, an
      Envelope consists of a protected header (included in the Issuer's
      signature) and an unprotected header (not included in the Issuer's
      signature).

   Equivocation:  a state where it is possible for a Transparency
      Service to provide different views of its Append-only log to
      Relying Parties about the same Artifact [EQUIVOCATION].

   Issuer:  an identifier representing an organization, device, user, or
      entity securing Statements about supply chain Artifacts.  An
      Issuer may be the owner or author of Artifacts, or an independent
      third party such as an Auditor, reviewer or an endorser.  In SCITT
      Statements and Receipts, the iss CWT Claim is a member of the COSE
      header parameter 15: CWT_Claims within the protected header of a
      COSE Envelope.

   Non-equivocation:  a state where it is impossible for a Transparency
      Service to provide different views of its Append-only Log to
      Relying Parties about the same Artifact.  Over time, an Issuer may
      register new Signed Statements about an Artifact in a Transparency
      Service with new information.  However, the consistency of a
      collection of Signed Statements about the Artifact can be checked
      by all Relying Parties.

   Receipt:  a cryptographic proof that a Signed Statement is included
      in the Append-only Log. Receipts are based on Signed Inclusion
      Proofs, such as those as described in COSE Signed Merkle Tree
      Proofs [I-D.draft-ietf-cose-merkle-tree-proofs]; they can be built
      on different verifiable data structures, not just binary merkle
      trees.  A Receipt consists of a Transparency Service-specific
      inclusion proof for the Signed Statement, a signature by the
      Transparency Service of the state of the Append-only Log after the
      inclusion, and additional metadata (contained in the signature's
      protected headers) to assist in auditing.

   Registration:  the process of submitting a Signed Statement to a
      Transparency Service, applying the Transparency Service's
      Registration Policy, adding to the Append-only Log, and producing
      a Receipt.

   Registration Policy:  the pre-condition enforced by the Transparency
      Service before registering a Signed Statement, based on
      information in the non-opaque header and metadata contained in its
      COSE Envelope.

   Relying Party:  a Relying Parties consumes Transparent Statements,
      verifying their proofs and inspecting the Statement payload,
      either before using corresponding Artifacts, or later to audit an
      Artifact's provenance on the supply chain.

   Signed Statement:  an identifiable and non-repudiable Statement about
      an Artifact signed by an Issuer.  In SCITT, Signed Statements are
      encoded as COSE signed objects; the payload of the COSE structure
      contains the issued Statement.

   Statement:  any serializable information about an Artifact.  To help
      interpretation of Statements, they must be tagged with a media
      type (as specified in [RFC6838]).  A Statement may represent a
      Software Bill Of Materials (SBOM) that lists the ingredients of a
      software Artifact, an endorsement or attestation about an
      Artifact, indicate the End of Life (EOL), redirection to a newer
      version, or any content an Issuer wishes to publish about an
      Artifact.  The additional Statements about an Artifact are
      correlated by the Subject defined in the [CWT_CLAIMS] protected
      header.  The Statement is considered opaque to Transparency
      Service, and MAY be encrypted.

   Subject:  an identifier, defined by the Issuer, that represents the
      organization, device, user, entity, or Artifact about which
      Statements (and Receipts) are made and by which a logical
      collection of Statements can be grouped.  It is possible that
      there are multiple Statements about the same Artifact.  In these
      cases, distinct Issuers (iss) might agree to use the sub CWT Claim
      to create a coherent sequence of Signed Statements about the same
      Artifact and Relying Parties can leverage sub to ensure
      completeness and Non-equivocation across Statements by identifying
      all Transparent Statements associated to a specific Subject.

   Transparency Service:  an entity that maintains and extends the
      Append-only Log, and endorses its state.  A Transparency Service
      can be a complex system, requiring the Transparency Service to
      provide many security guarantees about its Append-only Log. The
      identity of a Transparency Service is captured by a public key
      that must be known by Relying Parties in order to validate
      Receipts.

   Transparent Statement:  a Signed Statement that is augmented with a
      Receipt created via Registration in a Transparency Service.  The
      Receipt is stored in the unprotected header of COSE Envelope of
      the Signed Statement.  A Transparent Statement remains a valid
      Signed Statement, and may be registered again in a different
      Transparency Service.

   Verifiable Data Structure:  a data structure which supports one or
      more proof types, such as "inclusion proofs" or "consistency
      proofs" (as defined in [I-D.draft-ietf-cose-merkle-tree-proofs]).

3.  Definition of Transparency

   In this document, the definition of transparency is intended to build
   over abstract notions of Append-only Logs and Receipts.  Existing
   transparency systems such as Certificate Transparency are instances
   of this definition.

   A Signed Statement is an identifiable and non-repudiable Statement
   made by an Issuer.  The Issuer selects additional metadata and
   attaches a proof of endorsement (in most cases, a signature) using
   the identity key of the Issuer that binds the Statement and its
   metadata.  Signed Statements can be made transparent by attaching a
   proof of Registration by a Transparency Service, in the form of a
   Receipt.  Receipts demonstrate inclusion of Signed Statements in the
   Append-only Log of a Transparency Service.  By extension, the Signed
   Statement may say an Artifact (for example, a firmware binary) is
   transparent if it comes with one or more Transparent Statements from
   its author or owner, though the context should make it clear what
   type of Signed Statements is expected for a given Artifact.

   Transparency does not prevent dishonest or compromised Issuers, but
   it holds them accountable.  Any Artifact that may be verified, is
   subject to scrutiny and auditing by other parties.  The Transparency
   Service provides a history of Statements, which may be made by
   multiple Issuers, enabling Relying Parties to make informed
   decisions.

   Transparency is implemented by providing a consistent, append-only,
   cryptographically verifiable, publicly available record of entries.
   A SCITT instance is referred to as a Transparency Service.
   Implementations of Transparency Services may protect their Append-
   only Log using a combination of trusted hardware, replication and
   consensus protocols, and cryptographic evidence.  A Receipt is an
   offline, universally-verifiable proof that an entry is recorded in
   the Append-only Log. Requesting a receipt can result in the
   production of a new receipt for the same signed statement.  A
   Receipt's verification key, signing algorithm, validity period,
   header parameters or other claims MAY change each time a Receipt is
   produced.

   Anyone with access to the Transparency Service can independently
   verify its consistency and review the complete list of Transparent
   Statements registered by each Issuer.  However, the Registrations on
   a separate Transparency Service is generally disjoint, though it is
   possible to take a Transparent Statement (i.e. a Signed Statement
   with a Receipt in its unprotected header, from a from the first
   Transparency Service) and register it on another Transparency
   Service, where the second Receipt will be over the first Receipt in
   the unprotected header.

   Reputable Issuers are thus incentivized to carefully review their
   Statements before signing them to produce Signed Statements.
   Similarly, reputable Transparency Services are incentivized to secure
   their Append-only Log, as any inconsistency can easily be pinpointed
   by any Auditor with read access to the Transparency Service.

   The building blocks defined in SCITT are intended to support
   applications in any supply chain that produces or relies upon digital
   Artifacts, from the build and supply of software and IoT devices to
   advanced manufacturing and food supply.

   SCITT is a generalization of Certificate Transparency (CT) [RFC9162],
   which can be interpreted as a transparency architecture for the
   supply chain of X.509 certificates.  Considering CT in terms of
   SCITT:

   *  CAs (Issuers) sign the ASN.1 DER encoded tbsCertificate structure
      to produce an X.509 certificate (Signed Statements)

   *  CAs submit the certificates to one or more CT logs (Transparency
      Services)

   *  CT logs produce Signed Certificate Timestamps (Transparent
      Statements)

   *  Signed Certificate Timestamps are checked by Relying Parties

   *  The Append-only Log can be checked by Auditors

4.  Architecture Overview

   The SCITT architecture consists of a very loose federation of
   Transparency Services, and a set of common formats and protocols for
   issuing and registering Signed Statements, and auditing Transparent
   Statements.

   In order to accommodate as many Transparency Service implementations
   as possible, this document only specifies the format of Signed
   Statements (which must be used by all Issuers) and a very thin
   wrapper format for Receipts, which specifies the Transparency Service
   identity and the agility parameters for the Signed Inclusion Proofs.
   Most of the details of the Receipt's contents are specified in the
   COSE Signed Merkle Tree Proof document
   [I-D.draft-ietf-cose-merkle-tree-proofs].

   The subsequent sections describe the main concepts, namely
   Transparency Service, Signed Statements, Registration, and
   Transparent Statements in more detail.

4.1.  Transparency Service

   Transparency Services MUST feature an Append-only Log. The Append-
   only Log is the verifiable data structure that records Signed
   Statements and supports the production of Receipts.

   All Transparency Services MUST expose APIs for the Registration of
   Signed Statements and issuance of Receipts.

   Transparency Services MAY support additional APIs for auditing, for
   instance, to query the history of Signed Statements.

   Typically a Transparency Service has a single Issuer identity which
   is present in the iss Claim of Receipts for that service.

   Multi-tenant support can be enabled through the use of identifiers in
   the iss Claim, for example, ts.example may have a distinct Issuer
   identity for each sub domain, such as customer1.ts.example and
   customer2.ts.example.

4.1.1.  Registration Policies

   Registration Policies refer to additional checks over and above the
   Mandatory Registration Checks that are performed before a Signed
   Statement is accepted to be registered to the Append-only Log.

   Transparency Services MUST maintain Registration Policies.

   Transparency Services MUST also maintain a list of trust anchors,
   which SHOULD be used by Relying Parties to authenticate Issuers, and
   which MAY be included in a Registration Policy statement.  For
   instance, a trust anchor could be an X.509 root certificate, the
   discovery URL of an OpenID Connect identity provider, or any other
   COSE compatible PKI trust anchor.

   Registration Policies and trust anchors MUST be made transparent and
   available to all Relying Parties of the Transparency Service by
   registering them as Signed Statements on the Append-only Log, and
   distributing the associated Receipts.

   This specification leaves implementation, encoding and documentation
   of Registration Policies and trust anchors to the operator of the
   Transparency Service.

4.1.1.1.  Mandatory Registration Checks

   During Registration, a Transparency Service MUST, at a minimum,
   syntactically check the Issuer of the Signed Statement by
   cryptographically verifying the COSE signature according to
   [RFC9052].  The Issuer identity MUST be bound to the Signed Statement
   by including an identifier in the protected header.  If the protected
   header includes multiple identifiers, all those that are registered
   by the Transparency Service MUST be checked.

   In essence, when using X.509 Signed Statements, the Transparency
   Service MUST build and validate a complete certificate chain from the
   Issuer's certificate identified by x5t located in the protected
   header of the COSE_Sign1 Envelope, to one of the root certificates
   most recently registered as a trust anchor of the Transparency
   Service.  An x5chain with a leaf certificate that corresponds to the
   x5t value MAY be included in the unprotected header in support of
   certain supply chain scenarios.

   The Transparency Service MUST apply the Registration Policy that was
   most recently added to the Append-only Log at the time of
   Registration.

4.1.1.2.  Auditability of Registration

   The operator of a Transparency Service MAY update the Registration
   Policy or the trust anchors of a Transparency Service at any time.

   Transparency Services MUST ensure that for any Signed Statement they
   register, enough information is made available to Auditors (either in
   the Append-only Log and retrievable through audit APIs, or included
   in the Receipt) to reproduce the Registration checks that were
   defined by the Registration Policies at the time of Registration.

4.1.2.  Initialization and Bootstrapping

   Since the mandatory Registration checks rely on having registered
   Signed Statements for the Registration Policy and trust anchors,
   Transparency Services MUST support at least one of the three
   following bootstrapping mechanisms:

   *  Pre-configured Registration Policy and trust anchors;

   *  Acceptance of a first Signed Statement whose payload is a valid
      Registration Policy, without performing Registration checks

   *  An out-of-band authenticated management interface

4.1.3.  Append-only Log

   The security properties of the Append-only Log are determined by the
   choice of the verifiable data structure used by the Transparency
   Service to implement the Log. This verifiable data structure MUST
   support the following security requirements:

   Append-Only:  once included in the verifiable data structure, a
      Signed Statement cannot be modified, deleted, or reordered; hence
      its Receipt provides an offline verifiable proof of Registration.

   Non-equivocation:  there is no fork in the Append-only Log. Everyone
      with access to its content sees the same collection of Signed
      Statements and can check that it is consistent with any Receipts
      they have verified.

   Replayability:  the Append-only Log includes sufficient information
      to enable authorized actors with access to its content to check
      that each included Signed Statement has been correctly registered.

   In addition to Receipts, some verifiable data structures might
   support additional proof types, such as proofs of consistency, or
   proofs of non inclusion.

   Specific verifiable data structures, such those describes in
   [RFC9162] and [I-D.draft-ietf-cose-merkle-tree-proofs], and the
   review of their security requirements for SCITT are out of scope for
   this document.

4.1.4.  Adjacent Services

   Transparency Services can be deployed along side other database or
   object storage technologies.  For example, a Transparency Service
   that is supporting a software package management system, might be
   referenced from the APIs exposed for package management.  Providing
   an ability to request a fresh Receipt for a given software package,
   or to request a list of Signed Statements associated with the
   software package.

4.2.  Signed Statements

   This specification prioritizes conformance to [RFC9052] and its
   required and optional properties.  Profiles and implementation
   specific choices should be used to determine admissability of
   conforming messages.  This specification is left intentionally open
   to allow implementations to make the restrictions that make the most
   sense for their operational use cases.

   There are many types of Statements (such as SBOMs, malware scans,
   audit reports, policy definitions) that Issuers may want to turn into
   Signed Statements.  An Issuer must first decide on a suitable format
   (3: payload type) to serialize the Statement payload.  For a software
   supply chain, payloads describing the software Artifacts may include:

   *  [COSWID]

   *  [CycloneDX]

   *  [in-toto]

   *  [SPDX-CBOR]

   *  [SPDX-JSON]

   *  [SLSA]

   *  [SWID]

   Once all the Envelope headers are set, an Issuer MUST use a standard
   COSE implementation to produce an appropriately serialized Signed
   Statement.  The SCITT tag COSE_Sign1_Tagged is outside the scope of
   COSE, and used to indicate that a signed object is a Signed
   Statement.

   Issuers can produce Signed Statements about different Artifacts under
   the same Identity.  Issuers and Relying Parties must be able to
   recognize the Artifact to which the Statements pertain by looking at
   the Signed Statement.  The iss and sub Claims, within the CWT_Claims
   protected header, are used to identify the Artifact the Statement
   pertains to.  (See Subject under Section 2 Terminology.)

   Issuers MAY use different signing keys (identified by kid in the
   resolved key manifest) for different Artifacts, or sign all Signed
   Statements under the same key.

   An Issuer can make multiple Statements about the same Artifact.  For
   example, an Issuer can make amended Statements about the same
   Artifact as their view changes over time.

   Multiple Issuers can make different, even conflicting Statements,
   about the same Artifact.  Relying Parties can choose which Issuers
   they trust.

   Multiple Issuers can make the same Statement about a single Artifact,
   affirming multiple Issuers agree.

   At least one identifier representing one credential MUST be included
   in the protected header of the COSE Envelope, as one of x5t or kid.
   Additionally, x5chain that corresponds to either x5t or kid
   identifying the leaf certificate in the included certification path
   MAY be included in the unprotected header of the COSE Envelope.

   *  When using x.509 certificates, support for x5t is REQUIRED to
      implement.

   *  Support for kid in the protected header and x5chain in the
      unprotected header is OPTIONAL to implement.

   When x5t is present, iss MUST be a string with a value between 1 and
   8192 characters in length that fits the regular expression of a
   distinguished name.

   The kid header parameter MUST be present when x5t is not present.
   Key discovery protocols are out-of-scope of this document.

   The protected header of a Signed Statement and a Receipt MUST include
   the CWT Claims header parameter as specified in Section 2 of
   [CWT_CLAIMS_COSE].  The CWT Claims value MUST include the Issuer
   Claim (Claim label 1) and the Subject Claim (Claim label 2)
   [IANA.cwt].

   A Receipt is a Signed Statement, (cose-sign1), with addition Claims
   in its protected header related to verifying the inclusion proof in
   its unprotected header.  See
   [I-D.draft-ietf-cose-merkle-tree-proofs].

4.2.1.  Signed Statement Examples

   Figure 1 illustrates a normative CDDL definition (see [RFC8610]) for
   of the protected header and unprotected header of Signed Statements
   and Receipts.

   Everything that is optional in the following CDDL definition can
   potentially be discovered out of band and Registration Policies are
   not assured on the presence of these optional fields.  A Registration
   Policy that requires an optional field to be present MUST reject any
   Signed Statements or Receipts that are invalid according to the
   Registration Policy.

   Signed_Statement = #6.18(COSE_Sign1)
   Receipt = #6.18(COSE_Sign1)

   COSE_Sign1 = [
     protected   : bstr .cbor Protected_Header,
     unprotected : Unprotected_Header,
     payload     : bstr / nil,
     signature   : bstr
   ]

   Protected_Header = {
     &(CWT_Claims: 15) => CWT_Claims
     ? &(alg: 1) => int
     ? &(content_type: 3) => tstr / uint
     ? &(kid: 4) => bstr
     ? &(x5t: 34) => COSE_CertHash
     * int => any
   }

   CWT_Claims = {
     &(iss: 1) => tstr
     &(sub: 2) => tstr
     * int => any
   }

   Unprotected_Header = {
     ? &(x5chain: 33) => COSE_X509
     ? &(receipts: 394)  => [+ Receipt]
     * int => any
   }

   }

4.3.  Registration

   To register a Signed Statement, the Transparency Service performs the
   following steps:

   1.  *Client authentication:* A Client authenticates with the
       Transparency Service, to Register Signed Statements on behalf of
       one or more Issuers.  Authentication and authorization is
       implementation-specific, and out of scope of the SCITT
       Architecture.

   2.  *Issuer Verification:* The Transparency Service MUST
       syntactically validate the Issuer's identity Claims, which may be
       different than the Client identity.

   3.  *Signature verification:* The Transparency Service MUST verify
       the signature of the Signed Statement, as described in [RFC9360],
       using the signature algorithm and verification key of the Issuer.

   4.  *Signed Statement validation:* The Transparency Service MUST
       check that the Signed Statement includes the required protected
       headers listed above.  The Transparency Service MAY verify the
       Statement payload format, content and other optional properties.

   5.  *Apply Registration Policy:* The Transparency Service MUST check
       the attributes required by a Registration Policy are present in
       the protected headers.  Custom Signed Statements are evaluated
       given the current Transparency Service state and the entire
       Envelope, and may use information contained in the attributes of
       named policies.

   6.  *Register the Signed Statement* to the Append-only Log.

   7.  *Return the Receipt*, which MAY be asynchronous from
       Registration.  The Transparency Service MUST be able to provide a
       Receipt for all registered Statements.  A Receipt for a Signed
       Statement MAY be provided asynchronously.  Details about
       generating Receipts are described in Section 4.4.

   The last two steps may be shared between a batch of Signed Statements
   recorded in the Append-only Log.

   A Transparency Service MUST ensure that a Signed Statement is
   registered before releasing its Receipt.

   The same Signed Statement may be independently registered in multiple
   Transparency Services, producing multiple, independent Receipts.  The
   multiple Receipts may be attached to the unprotected header of the
   Signed Statement, creating a Transparent Statement.

4.4.  Transparent Statements

   The Client (which is not necessarily the Issuer) that registers a
   Signed Statement and receives a Receipt can produce a Transparent
   Statement by adding the Receipt to the unprotected header of the
   Signed Statement.  Client applications MAY register Signed Statements
   on behalf of one or more Issuers.  Client applications MAY request
   Receipts regardless of the identity of the Issuer of the associated
   Signed Statement.

   When a Signed Statement is registered by a Transparency Service a
   Receipt becomes available.  When a Receipt is included in a Signed
   Statement a Transparent Statement is produced.

   Receipts are based on Signed Inclusion Proofs as described in COSE
   Signed Merkle Tree Proofs ([I-D.draft-ietf-cose-merkle-tree-proofs])
   that also provides the COSE header parameter semantics for label 394.

   The Registration time is recorded as the timestamp when the
   Transparency Service added this Signed Statement to its Append-only
   Log.

   Figure 4 illustrates a normative CDDL definition of Transparent
   Statements.

   Transparent_Statement = #6.18(COSE_Sign1)

   Unprotected_Header = {
     &(receipts: 394)  => [+ Receipt]
   }

           Figure 4: CDDL definition for a Transparent Statement

   Figure 5 illustrates a Transparent Statement with a detached payload,
   and two Receipts in its unprotected header.  The type of label 394
   receipts in the unprotected header is a CBOR array that can contain
   one or more Receipts (each entry encoded as a .cbor encoded
   Receipts).

   18(                                 / COSE Sign 1                   /

4.4.1.  Validation

   Relying Parties MUST apply the verification process as described in
   Section 4.4 of RFC9052, when checking the signature of Signed
   Statements and Receipts.

   A Relying Party MUST trust the verification key or certificate and
   the associated identity of at least one Issuer of a Receipt.

   A Relying Party MAY decide to verify only a single Receipt that is
   acceptable to them, and not check the signature on the Signed
   Statement or Receipts which rely on verifiable data structures which
   they do not understand.

   APIs exposing verification logic for Transparent Statements may
   provide more details than a single boolean result.  For example, an
   API may indicate if the signature on the Receipt or Signed Statement
   is valid, if Claims related to the validity period are valid, or if
   the inclusion proof in the Receipt is valid.

   Relying Parties MAY be configured to re-verify the Issuer's Signed
   Statement locally.

   In addition, Relying Parties MAY apply arbitrary validation policies
   after the Transparent Statement has been verified and validated.
   Such policies may use as input all information in the Envelope, the
   Receipt, and the Statement payload, as well as any local state.

5.  Privacy Considerations

   Transparency Services are often publicly accessible.  Issuers should
   treat Signed Statements (rendering them as Transparent Statements) as
   publicly accessible.  In particular, a Signed Statement Envelope and
   Statement payload should not carry any private information in
   plaintext.

   Transparency Services can have an authorization policy controlling
   who can access the Append-only Log. While this can be used to limit
   who can read the Log, it may also limit the usefulness of the system.

   Once a cryptographic digest of the Signed Statement is registered on
   the Append-only Log, the registration cannot be removed from the
   Append-only Log.

6.  Security Considerations

   On its own, verifying a Transparent Statement does not guarantee that
   its Envelope or contents are trustworthy.  Just that they have been
   signed by the apparent Issuer and counter-signed by the Transparency
   Service.  If the Relying Party trusts the Issuer, after validation of
   the Issuer identity, it can infer that an Issuer's Signed Statement
   was issued with this Envelope and contents, which may be interpreted
   as the Issuer saying the Artifact is fit for its intended purpose.
   If the Relying Party trusts the Transparency Service, it can
   independently infer that the Signed Statement passed the Transparency
   Service Registration Policy and that has been persisted in the
   Append-only Log. Unless advertised in the Transparency Service
   Registration Policy, the Relying Party cannot assume that the
   ordering of Signed Statements in the Append-only Log matches the
   ordering of their issuance.

   Similarly, the fact that an Issuer can be held accountable for its
   Transparent Statements does not on its own provide any mitigation or
   remediation mechanism in case one of these Transparent Statements
   turned out to be misleading or malicious.  Just that signed evidence
   will be available to support them.

   An Issuer that knows of a changed state of quality for an Artifact,
   SHOULD Register a new Signed Statement, using the same 15 CWT iss and
   sub Claims.

   Issuers MUST ensure that the Statement payloads in their Signed
   Statements are correct and unambiguous, for example by avoiding ill-
   defined or ambiguous formats that may cause Relying Parties to
   interpret the Signed Statement as valid for some other purpose.

   Issuers and Transparency Services MUST carefully protect their
   private signing keys and avoid these keys being used for any purpose
   not described in this architecture document.  In cases where key re-
   use is unavoidable, keys MUST NOT sign any other message that may be
   verified as an Envelope as part of a Signed Statement.

   Each of these functions MUST be carefully protected against both
   external attacks and internal misbehavior by some or all of the
   operators of the Transparency Service.

   For instance, the code for the Registration Policy evaluation and
   endorsement may be protected by running in a Trusted Execution
   Environment (TEE).

   The Transparency Service may be replicated with a consensus
   algorithm, such as Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance [PBFT] and may
   be used to protect against malicious or vulnerable replicas.
   Threshold signatures may be use to protect the service key, etc.

   Issuers and Transparency Services MUST rotate verification keys for
   signature checking in well-defined cryptoperiods (see
   [KEY-MANAGEMENT]).

   A Transparency Service MAY provide additional authenticity assurances
   about its secure implementation and operation, enabling remote
   attestation of the hardware platforms and/or software Trusted
   Computing Bases (TCB) that run the Transparency Service.  If present,
   these additional authenticity assurances MUST be registered in the
   Append-only Log and MUST always be exposed by the Transparency
   Services' APIs.  An example of Signed Statement's payloads that can
   improve authenticity assurances are trustworthiness assessments that
   are RATS Conceptual Messages, such as Evidence, Endorsements, or
   corresponding Attestation Results (see [RFC9334]).

   For example, if a Transparency Service is implemented using a set of
   redundant replicas, each running within its own hardware-protected
   trusted execution environments (TEEs), then each replica can provide
   fresh Evidence or fresh Attestation Results about its TEEs.  The
   respective Evidence can show, for example, the binding of the
   hardware platform to the software that runs the Transparency Service,
   the long-term public key of the service, or the key used by the
   replica for signing Receipts.  The respective Attestation Result, for
   example, can show that the remote attestation Evidence was appraised
   by a Relying Party and complies with well-known Reference Values and
   Endorsements.

   Auditors should be aware that the certification path information
   included in an unprotected x5chain header of a to-be-registered
   Signed Statement can be tampered with by a malicious Transparency
   Service (e.g., one that does not incorporate remote attestation),
   which may replace the intermediate certificates and ultimately
   connect to an unexpected root.  This modification helps protect
   against person-in-the-middle attacks, but not denial-of-service.
   Auditors MUST perform certification path validation in accordance
   with PKIX rules specified in [RFC5280].  In particular, Auditors MUST
   verify that certification paths chain to one or more trust anchors
   (often represented as root certificates).

6.1.  Security Guarantees

   SCITT provides the following security guarantees:

   1.  Statements made by Issuers about supply chain Artifacts are
       identifiable, can be authenticated, and once authenticated, are
       non-repudiable

   2.  Statement provenance and history can be independently and
       consistently audited

   3.  Issuers can efficiently prove that their Statement is logged by a
       Transparency Service

   The first guarantee is achieved by requiring Issuers to sign their
   Statements and associated metadata using a distributed public key
   infrastructure.  The second guarantee is achieved by storing the
   Signed Statement on an Append-only Log. The third guarantee is
   achieved by implementing the Append-only Log using a verifiable data
   structure (such as a Merkle Tree [MERKLE]).

6.2.  Threat Model

   This section provides a generic threat model for SCITT, describing
   its residual security properties when some of its actors (Issuers,
   Transparency Services, and Auditors) are corrupt or compromised.

   This threat model may need to be refined to account for specific
   supply chain use cases.

   SCITT primarily supports checking of Signed Statement authenticity,
   both from the Issuer (authentication) and from the Transparency
   Service (transparency).  These guarantees are meant to hold for
   extensive periods of time, possibly decades.

   It can never be assumed that some Issuers and some Transparency
   Services will not be corrupt.

   SCITT entities explicitly trust one another on the basis of their
   long-term identity, which maps to shorter-lived cryptographic
   credentials.  A Relying Party SHOULD validate a Transparent Statement
   originating from a given Issuer, registered at a given Transparency
   Service (both identified in the Relying Party's local authorization
   policy) and would not depend on any other Issuer or Transparency
   Services.

   Issuers cannot be stopped from producing Signed Statements including
   false assertions in their Statement payload (either by mistake or by
   corruption), but these Issuers can made accountable by ensuring their
   Signed Statements are systematically registered at a Transparency
   Service.

   Similarly, providing strong residual guarantees against faulty/
   corrupt Transparency Services is a SCITT design goal.  Preventing a
   Transparency Service from registering Signed Statements that do not
   meet its stated Registration Policy, or to issue Receipts that are
   not consistent with their Append-only Log is not possible.  In
   contrast Transparency Services can be held accountable and they can
   be called out by any Auditor that replays their Append-only Log
   against any contested Receipt.  Note that the SCITT Architecture does
   not require trust in a single centralized Transparency Service.
   Different actors may rely on different Transparency Services, each
   registering a subset of Signed Statements subject to their own
   policy.

   In both cases, the SCITT architecture provides generic, universally-
   verifiable cryptographic proofs to individually blame Issuers or the
   Transparency Service.  On one hand, this enables valid actors to
   detect and disambiguate malicious actors who employ Equivocation with
   Signed Statements to different entities.  On the other hand, their
   liability and the resulting damage to their reputation are
   application specific, and out of scope of the SCITT architecture.

   Relying Parties and Auditors need not be trusted by other actors.  In
   particular, so long as actors maintain proper control of their
   signing keys and identity infrastructure they cannot "frame" an
   Issuer or a Transparency Service for Signed Statements they did not
   issue or register.

6.2.1.  Append-only Log

   If a Transparency Service is honest, then a Transparent Statement
   including a correct Receipt ensures that the associated Signed
   Statement passed its Registration Policy and was recorded
   appropriately.

   Conversely, a corrupt Transparency Service may:

   1.  refuse or delay the Registration of Signed Statements

   2.  register Signed Statements that do not pass its Registration
       Policy (e.g., Signed Statement with Issuer identities and
       signatures that do not verify)

   3.  issue verifiable Receipts for Signed Statements that do not match
       its Append-only Log

   4.  refuse access to its Transparency Service (e.g., to Auditors,
       possibly after storage loss)

   An Auditor granted (partial) access to a Transparency Service and to
   a collection of disputed Receipts will be able to replay it, detect
   any invalid Registration (2) or incorrect Receipt in this collection
   (3), and blame the Transparency Service for them.  This ensures any
   Relying Party that trusts at least one such Auditor that (2, 3) will
   be blamed to the Transparency Service.

   Due to the operational challenge of maintaining a globally consistent
   Append-only Log, some Transparency Services may provide limited
   support for historical queries on the Signed Statements they have
   registered, and accept the risk of being blamed for inconsistent
   Registration or Issuer Equivocation.

   Relying Parties and Auditors may also witness (1, 4) but may not be
   able to collect verifiable evidence for it.

6.2.2.  Availability of Receipts

   Networking and Storage are trusted only for availability.

   Auditing may involve access to data beyond what is persisted in the
   Transparency Services.  For example, the registered Transparency
   Service may include only the hash of a detailed SBOM, which may limit
   the scope of auditing.

   Resistance to denial-of-service is implementation specific.

   Actors may want to independently keep their own record of the Signed
   Statements they issue, endorse, verify, or audit.

6.2.3.  Confidentiality and Privacy

   All contents exchanged between actors is protected using secure
   authenticated channels (e.g., TLS) but may not exclude network
   traffic analysis.

   The Transparency Service is trusted with the confidentiality of the
   Signed Statements presented for Registration.  Some Transparency
   Services may publish every Signed Statement in their logs, to
   facilitate their dissemination and auditing.  Transparency Services
   MAY return Receipts to Client applications synchronously or
   asynchronously.

   A collection of Signed Statements must not leak information about the
   contents of other Signed Statements registered on the Transparency
   Service.

   Issuers must carefully review the inclusion of private/confidential
   materials in their Statements.  For example, Issuers must remove
   Personally Identifiable Information (PII) as clear text in the
   Statement.  Alternatively, Issuers may include opaque cryptographic
   Statements, such as hashes.

   The confidentiality of queries is implementation-specific, and
   generally not guaranteed.  For example, while offline Envelope
   validation of Signed Statements is private, a Transparency Service
   may monitor which of its Transparent Statements are being verified
   from lookups to ensure their freshness.

6.2.4.  Cryptographic Agility

   The SCITT Architecture supports cryptographic agility.  The actors
   depend only on the subset of signing and Receipt schemes they trust.
   This enables the gradual transition to stronger algorithms, including
   e.g. post-quantum signature algorithms.

6.2.5.  Transparency Service Client Applications

   Authentication of Client applications is out of scope for this
   document.  Transparency Services MUST authenticate both Client
   applications and the Issuer of Signed Statements in order to ensure
   that implementation specific authentication and authorization
   policies are enforced.  The specification of authentication and
   authorization policies is out of scope for this document.

6.2.6.  Impersonation

   The identity resolution mechanism is trusted to associate long-term
   identifiers with their public signature-verification keys.
   Transparency Services and other parties may record identity-
   resolution evidence to facilitate its auditing.

   If one of the credentials of an Issuer gets compromised, the SCITT
   Architecture still guarantees the authenticity of all Signed
   Statements signed with this credential that have been registered on a
   Transparency Service before the compromise.  It is up to the Issuer
   to notify Transparency Services of credential revocation to stop
   Relying Parties from accepting Signed Statements signed with
   compromised credentials.

Appendix A.  Common Terminology Disambiguation

   This document has been developed in coordination with the COSE, OAUTH
   and RATS WG and uses terminology common to these working groups.

   This document uses the terms "Issuer", and "Subject" as described in
   [RFC8392], however the usage is consistent with the broader
   interpretation of these terms in both JOSE and COSE, and in
   particular, the guidance in [RFC8725] generally applies the COSE
   equivalent terms with consistent semantics.

   The terms "verifier" and "Relying Party" are used interchangeably
   through the document.  While these terms are related to "Verifier"
   and "Relying Party" as used in [RFC9334], they do not imply the
   processing of RATS conceptual messages, such as Evidence or
   Attestation Results that are specific to remote attestation.  A SCITT
   "verifier" and "Relying Party" and "Issuer" of Receipts or Statements
   might take on the role of a RATS "Attester".  Correspondingly, all
   RATS conceptual messages, such as Evidence and Attestation Results,
   can be the content of SCITT Statements and a SCITT "verifier" can
   also take on the role of a RATS "Verifier" to, for example, conduct
   the procedure of Appraisal of Evidence as a part of a SCITT
   "verifier"'s verification capabilities.

   The terms "Claim" and "Statement" are used throughout this document,
   where Claim is consistent with the usage in [I-D.draft-ietf-rats-eat]
   and [RFC7523], and Statement is reserved for any arbitrary bytes,
   possibly identified with a media type, about which the Claims are
   made.

   The term "Subject" provides an identifier of the Issuer's choosing to
   refer to a given Artifact, and ensures that all associated Statements
   can be attributed to the identifier chosen by the Issuer.

   In simpler language, a SCITT Statement could be some vendor-specific
   software bill of materials (SBOM), results from a model checker,
   static analyzer, or RATS Evidence about the authenticity of an SBOM
   creation process, where the Issuer identifies themselves using the
   iss Claim, and the specific software that was analyzed as the Subject
   using the sub Claim.

   In [RFC7523], the Authorization Server (AS) verifies Private Key JWT
   client authentication requests, and issues access tokens to clients
   configured to use "urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-
   bearer".  This means the AS initially acts as a "verifier" of the
   authentication credentials in form of a JWT, and then later as an
   "Issuer" of access and refresh tokens.  This mirrors how Signed
   Statements are verified before Receipts are issued by a Transparency
   Service.  Note that the use of [RFC7523] is only one possible
   approach for client authentication in OAuth.

   [FIPS.201] defines "assertion" as "A verifiable statement from an IdP
   to an RP that contains information about an end user".

   [NIST.SP.800-63-3] defines "assertion" as "A statement from a
   verifier to an RP that contains information about a subscriber.
   Assertions may also contain verified attributes."

   This document uses the term Statement to refer to potentially
   unsecured data and associated Claims, and Signed Statement and
   Receipt to refer to assertions from an Issuer, or the Transparency
   Service.

   [NIST.SP.1800-19] defines "attestation" as "The process of providing
   a digital signature for a set of measurements securely stored in
   hardware, and then having the requester validate the signature and
   the set of measurements."

   NIST guidance "Software Supply Chain Security Guidance EO 14028" uses
   the definition from [ISO.17000.2020], which states that an
   "attestation" is "The issue of a statement, based on a decision, that
   fulfillment of specified requirements has been demonstrated.".  In
   the RATS context, a "NIST attestation" is similar to a RATS
   "Endorsement".  Occasionally, RATS Evidence and RATS Attestation
   Results or the procedures of creating these conceptual messages are
   referred to as "attestation" or (in cases of the use as a verb) "to
   attest".  The stand-alone use of "attestation" and "to attest" is
   discouraged outside a well-defined context, such as specification
   text that highlights the application of terminology, explicitly.
   Correspondingly, it is often useful for the intended audience to
   qualify the term "attestation" to avoid confusion and ambiguity.

Appendix B.  Identifiers

   This section provides informative examples of identifiers for
   Statements, Signed Statements, and Receipts.

   SCITT Identifiers are primarily meant to be understood by humans and
   secondarily meant to be understood by machines, as such we define
   text encodings for message identifiers first, and then provide binary
   translations according to standard transformations for URLs and URNs
   to binary formats.

   SCITT Identifiers for URLs and URNs that are not Data URLs MUST be
   represented in binary using [I-D.draft-ietf-core-href].

   For each SCITT conceptual message, we define a Data URL format
   according to [RFC2397], a URN format according to [RFC8141] and a URL
   format according to [URLs].

   Note that Data URLs require base64 encoding, but the URN definitions
   require base64url encoding.

   Resolution and dereferencing of these identifiers is out of scope for
   this document, and can be implemented by any concrete api
   implementing the abstract interface defined as follows:

   resource: content-type = dereference(identifier: identifier-type)

   These identifiers MAY be present in a tstr field that does not
   otherwise restrict the string in ways that prevent a URN or URL from
   being present.

   This includes iss, and sub which are used to express the Issuer and
   Subject of a Signed Statement or Receipt.

   This also includes kid which is used to express a hint for which
   public key should be used to verify a signature.

   All SCITT identifiers share common parameters to promote
   interoperability:

   Let hash-name be an algorithm name registered in
   [IANA.named-information].

   To promote interoperability, the hash-name MUST be "sha-256".

   Let base-encoding, be a base encoding defined in [RFC4648].

   To promote interoperability, the base encoding MUST be "base64url".

   In the blocks and examples that follow, note '' line wrapping per RFC
   8792.

B.1.  Identifiers For Binary Content

   Identifiers for binary content, such as Statements, or even Artifacts
   themselves are computed as follows:

   Let the base64url-encoded-bytes-digest for the message be the
   base64url encoded digest with the chosen hash algorithm of bytes /
   octets.

   Let the SCITT name for the message be the URN constructed from the
   following URI template, according to [RFC6570]:

   Let the message-type, be "statement" for Statements about Artifacts.

   urn:ietf:params:scitt:\
   {message-type}:\
   {hash-name}:{base-encoding}:\
   {base64url-encoded-bytes-digest}

B.2.  Identifiers For SCITT Messages

   Identifiers for COSE Sign 1 based messages, such as identifiers for
   Signed Statements and Receipts are computed as follows:

   Let the base64url-encoded-to-be-signed-bytes-digest for the message
   be the base64url encoded digest with the chosen hash algorithm of the
   "to-be-signed bytes", according to Section 8.1 of [RFC9052].

   Let the SCITT name for the message be the URN constructed from the
   following URI template, according to [RFC6570]:

   Let the message-type, be "signed-statement" for Signed Statements,
   and "receipt" for Receipts.

   urn:ietf:params:scitt:\
   {message-type}:\
   {hash-name}:{base-encoding}:\
   {base64url-encoded-to-be-signed-bytes-digest}

   Note that this means the content of the signature is not included in
   the identifier, even though signature related Claims, such as
   activation or expiration information in protected headers are
   included.

   As a result, an attacker may construct a new Signed Statement that
   has the same identifier as a previous Signed Statement, but has a
   different signature.

B.3.  Identifiers For Transparent Statements

   Identifiers for Transparent Statements are defined as identifiers for
   binary content, but with "transparent-statement" as the message-type.

   urn:ietf:params:scitt:\
   {message-type}:\
   {hash-name}:{base-encoding}:\
   {base64url-encoded-bytes-digest}

   Note that because this identifier is computed over the unprotected
   header of the Signed Statement, any changes to the unprotected
   header, such as changing the order of the unprotected header map key
   value pairs, adding additional Receipts, or adding additional proofs
   to a Receipt, will change the identifier of a Transparent Statement.

   Note that because this identifier is computed over the signatures of
   the Signed Statement and signatures in each Receipt, any
   canonicalization of the signatures after the fact will produce a
   distinct identifier.

Appendix C.  Signing Statements Remotely

   Statements about digital Artifacts, containing digital Artifacts, or
   structured data regarding any type of Artifacts, can be too large or
   too sensitive to be send to a remote Transparency Services over the
   Internet.  In these cases a Statement can also be hash, which becomes
   the payload included in COSE to-be-signed bytes.  A Signed Statement
   (cose-sign1) MUST be produced from the to-be-signed bytes according
   to Section 4.4 of [RFC9052].
